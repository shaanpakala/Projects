<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b><u>Automating Data Science Pipelines with Tensor Completion</u></b></p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Submitted paper as first author to <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ieeebigdata2024/" target="_blank">IEEE Big Data 2024</a> (under review). This project was funded by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2244480&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF REU</a> program during Summer 2024. Here I worked under UC Riverside Professors, in collaboration with Ph.D. & B.S. students, to research automatic and efficient hyperparameter optimization using <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~my2550/talks/tensortalk2.pdf">tensor completion</a> algorithms. This was also extended to inferring the cardinality of SQL queries.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/article/50051/uc-merced-uc-riverside-tackle-data-science-challenge-machine-learning-assisted-heart">2023 Data Science Challenge</a>, I worked in a team to develop data driven solutions to problems in cardiology. This included automated heart disease classification, as well as a 3D reconstruction of human heart activity over 500ms, using solely non-invasive electrocardiogram data.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b><u>Simulated Online Store Database</u></b></p>

</a>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Final Project for Database Management Systems (CS166 at UC Riverside). Here I worked in a team of 2 to implement a relational database for a simulated online store, using PostgreSQL & Java for UI. This included 5 tables, as well as implementing triggers and indexes for improved efficiency. Customer, manager, and admin functions were included to mimic a real online store experience.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b><u>Image Segmentation</u></b></p>

<a href="https://github.com/shaanpakala/random_image_segmentations" target="_blank">

</a>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Some image segmentation projects I have worked on, mainly to familiarize myself with modern computer vision and image processing techniques. Overall, I learned how to develop a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net" target="_blank">U-Net</a> architecture with skip connections, using PyTorch. I also learned some image processing techniques using OpenCV.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b><u>Wikipedia Article Visualization & Classification</u></b></p>

<a href="https://github.com/shaanpakala/LLM_text_classification" target="_blank">
  <img align="left" width="225" height="125" src="images/wiki_viz.png">
</a>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Webscraped Wikipedia articles of several categories, and then converted them to hidden states using Google's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)" target="_blank">BERT</a>. From here, I compressed each text input's 2D hidden state to a vector of size 2 for a scatter plot visualization. This highlighted the different in articles of different categories, and the similaries of those in the same category. From here, topic classification was relatively trivial.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b><u>Online Reviews Sentiment Analysis</u></b></p>

<a href="https://github.com/shaanpakala/sentiment_classification" target="_blank">
  <img align="left" width="225" height="125" src="images/sentiment_classification_pic.png">
</a>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Started as a final project for Data Analysis Methods (CS105 at UC Riverside), but I got carried away and extended it. I webscraped online reviews (from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank">yelp</a> & <a href="https://www.yellowpages.com/" target="_blank">yp</a>) to build a machine learning model (random forest) to classify online reviews' sentiment. The bulk of the work was text preprocessing, as well as text vectorization in a way to makes it easy for the machine learning model to classify.</p>
